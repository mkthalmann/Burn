# Burn Results

These are the results of the gaming sessions my friends and I have (about) once a week. We have actually been playing this game since the start of the first lockdown in Germany but only recently started logging our results. In particular, we track who wins how many games every night (the more, the better) and our own personal card draw highscores (the higher the amount, the more shameful).

Due to the online nature of our get-togethers, we play on [playingcards.io](https://playingcards.io) in a custom room, with houserules and bespoke card backs. The cards and room settings can be found in the `cards` directory.

This is all in good fun but feedback is, of course, always appreciated.
